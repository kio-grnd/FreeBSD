First, to have UTF-8 you need a vt console, for this you need to add

sudo nano /boot/loader.conf
hw.vga.textmode=1

Next, in your /etc/rc.conf you must have keymap="es"

In /etc/login.conf you need to add at least this:
sudo nano /etc/login.conf
spanish|Spanish Users Accounts:\
:charset=UTF-8:\
:lang=es_ES.UTF-8:

Then in terminal run: 
sudo cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

And finally:
sudo pw user mod root -L spanish
